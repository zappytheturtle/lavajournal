		<p name="poop">We are paragraphs! THIS PARAGRAPH HAS AN ATTRIBUTE CALLED "NAME." IDK IF IT'S REAL. BUT IF YOU GO TO CSS AND SAY p[name] IT WILL SELECT FOR PARAGRAPHS WITH AN ATTRIBUTE CALLED NAME. YOU CAN ALSO SPECIFY A VALUE WITH element[ATTRIBUTE]="VALUE"!!!! THIS PARAGRAPH'S NAME ATTRIBUTE IS CALLED POOP! HA HA HA!</p>
		<p name="mybacon"> so cool! This one has the same thing except like this: p[name^="my"] because the name is "mybacon" and I'm selecting for things that start with "my"!</p>
		<p name="yourbakon">Yessss. This one is a little different! I selected for things that end with "bakon" because I'm vegan! The name is "yourbakon"! I did it like this! p[name$="bakon"]!</p>
		<p name="moom">THIS ONE HAS name*="moom" because then it searches for any name value with moom in it !</p>
