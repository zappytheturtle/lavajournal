			<p>I AM A CHILD OF A DIV. THIS PARAGRAPH. IS IN A DIV. ALSO IM A GRANDCHILD OF THE BODY ELEMENT BECAUSE THE DIV IS IN THE BODY! HA HA HA!</p>
			<p>YOU CAN STYLE ANY CHILD ELEMENT BY TARGETTING THEM BY SAYING SOMETHING LIKE "p:nth-child(3) WITH THE "3" BEING THE WHATEVER NUMBER CHILD!!! AND THE P IS THE CHILD ELEMENT!!!</p>
			<p>ALL THAT MEANS IS IF YOU'RE A PARAGRAPH THAT'S ALSO THE THIRD CHILD OF ANY FREAKIN ELEMENT, THEN YOU GET STYLED MANG!!!</p>		
			<p>ALSO YOU CAN REPLACE THAT NUMBER WITH A CSS KEYWORD, LIKE "EVEN" AND "ODD" OR FORUMLAS APPARENTLY LIKE IN EXCEL MAYBE IDEK! So p:nth-child(even) { color:blue; } is making the 2nd and 4th paragraph BLUE!!! YOOOOOOU!</p>
