						</hgroup>
					</header>
					
					<p>Chachee is Chachee, betch! Get yo shit together! Paragraph tags!</p>
					
					 <p> Paragraph 2! Also h1 and h2 are different sizes because they're in a section! Random rules, just change it if you want to in CSS!</p>
					
					<footer>
						<p>This here's the footer! in paragraph tags!</p>

				<article>
					<header>
						<hgroup>
							<h1>A2 Header 1</h1>
							<h2>A2 Header 2</h2>
							<h3>A2 header 3! We're in an hgroup, in a header, in an article, in a section!</h3>
						</hgroup>
					</header>
					
					<p>The * selector made margin and padding 0px! Then the h1 and h2 tags were changed to "font: bold 20px Tahoma" ! Weight, Size, and Font Family is the order! h2 got 16 px to make it smaller though!</p>
					
					<p>Then we did this:</p>
					<p>header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, hgroup {display:block;}</p>
					<p>Because apparently some browsers treat those tags (html5...semantic...tags?) as inline elements or don't recognize them. So we made sure it is treated as a block element.</p>
					<p>Also then we put text-align:center in the body element in css too because of browser junk. I guess even tho this is all in that div, older browsers need this to make sure the website is centered otherwise it'll be shifted to the left.</p>

						<p>This here's the footer! in paragraph tags!</p>
